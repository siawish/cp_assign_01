Computer Programming Assignment given by Dr.Raja Suleman.  
                                                            ALGORITHMS:
In this assignment, I delved into the world of algorithms, which are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming.
I was  presented with four real-world scenarios, and my task was to create algorithms to solve these problems efficiently.
These scenarios  tested my problem-solving skills and my ability to design algorithms that can be implemented in a programming language of my choice.
